API Documentation
=================

An API to return movie data is built on Tastypie webservice API framework, in order to obtain a convenient, yet powerful and highly customizable, abstraction for creating REST-style interface. The justification for chosing Tastypie over other API frameworks is discussed in Design section.

Following imports are required from tastypie::

	from tastypie.resources import ModelResource
	from tastypie import fields
	from tastypie.api import Api
	from tastypie.exceptions import InvalidFilterError
	from tastypie.authentication import Authentication
	from tastypie.authorization import Authorization
	from tastypie import fields
	from tastypie.exceptions import BadRequest
	from tastypie.serializers import Serializer
	from tastypie.http import HttpUnauthorized, HttpForbidden
	from tastypie.utils import trailing_slash

Creating new API variable and registering it::

	v1_api = Api(api_name='v1')
	v1_api.register(CriticResource())
	v1_api.register(ReviewResource())
	v1_api.register(UserCriticResource())
	v1_api.register(UserResource())
	v1_api.register(CreateUserResource())
	v1_api.register(UserLoginResource())

The items getting registered are the classes. These are also defined in the same python file ``api.py``, where the registering of API is done.
